# Opentrons High-Throughput Proxy Viscometer

Supplementary Files for our project titled **_Automated Pipetting Robot for Proxy High-Throughput Viscometry of Newtonian Fluids_**

`OT-2_ProxyViscometerProtocol.py` is the Python protocol file which needs to be uploaded to an Opentrons OT-2 robot to reproduce the protocol demonstrated in the paper. Full instructions to clone this repo and run the protocol are presented in the paper's Supplementary Information (SI).
